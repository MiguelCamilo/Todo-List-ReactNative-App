<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
- This is a simple to-do list app that allows users to add tasks and view them in a list. The app is built using React Native and utilizes the useState hook to manage the state of the tasks.
Overall, this app provides a simple and easy to use interface for managing and viewing tasks.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev)

## Features

- The App component has two main functions, handleAddTask and deleteTask. The handleAddTask function is called when the user taps on the plus icon and adds the current task to the taskItems array. The deleteTask function is called when the user taps on the delete icon next to a task, and it removes that task from the taskItems array.
- The Task component is a simple component that takes a single prop, text, and displays it as a Text component.
